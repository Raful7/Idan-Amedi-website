# Idan-Amedi-website

This is my first little project in full stack development domain, as a part of my course. 
This project is composed of 4 pages including the main page, biography page, gallery page and contact page. 
All these pages were based of HTML for building the structure of the pages.
In addition, every page has it's own css page for styling.

Here is some little description about the pages:

1)main page- This is the first page of the web. Here you can find a short description about Idan Amedi and also a short description about the functionality of this web.
2)biography page- This is the biography page. In this page, I discussed in detail about Idan's life and how he become one of the best singers in Israel. 
3)gallery page - This is a page that contains some photos from the different aspects of Idan in his life.
4)contact page- My favorite page. This page contains a beautiful contact form which allows the users to contact the owner of the web(me) if he needs.

Enjoy my little web!
