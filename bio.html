Most of the songs Amedi co-edited with Itamar Meiri and Eitan Raz.<br />

                        In addition, Amedi wrote a song based on Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau's book "Don't Send Your Hand to the Boy," called "Continues to Walk," as part of "The Voice Still Remains" project in collaboration with Reshet Gimel and Holocaust Memorial Information.<br />

                        The album also includes "Pain of Warriors", which won the title "Song of the Year" in the annual 2011 chorus parades.<br />

                        In the same year, Amedi also won the Rookie of the Year title in the Reshet Gimel network. The album was released by 'Aroma Music'.<br />
